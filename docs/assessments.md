# Assessments

This section details the assessment methods for the course.

# What You’ll Build and Be Graded On

Throughout the course, you’ll complete hands-on projects that build progressively toward your **capstone: a fully autonomous humanoid robot**. Each assessment helps you apply what you’ve learned and ensures you gain practical, real-world skills.

---

## ROS 2 Package Development Project

- Build a basic robot control package connecting **sensors → actuators → decision logic**.  
- Learn to modularize code using **nodes, topics, and actions**.  
- Test and debug individual modules before integrating into larger systems.  

Think of it like **assembling a car engine**: each part must work independently before the whole system runs smoothly.

## Gazebo Simulation Task

- Make your robot navigate a virtual environment.  
- Avoid obstacles, detect objects, and reach designated targets.  
- Apply your understanding of physics simulation and sensor data.  

This is equivalent to **flight training in a simulator** — you can make mistakes safely without damaging real hardware.

## Isaac Perception Pipeline

- Build a perception pipeline using **Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS**.  
- Implement **VSLAM** for mapping and navigation.  
- Enable your robot to recognize objects, plan paths, and move intelligently.  

Imagine teaching a person to **explore a new house** and remember where furniture and obstacles are, all while walking around safely.

## Capstone Project — Autonomous Humanoid Robot

By the end of the course, you’ll integrate everything into a **working humanoid**:

- Receives **voice commands** from a human.  
- Uses perception to **identify objects and obstacles**.  
- Plans a path and **navigates complex environments**.  
- Grasps and manipulates objects with precision.  
- Executes multi-step tasks autonomously.  

It’s like giving your robot a **job in the real world** — it listens, thinks, and acts independently.

## Why These Assessments Matter

- Reinforce your understanding of **ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and motion control**.  
- Provide incremental **hands-on experience** before tackling the capstone.  
- Build confidence and practical skills that transfer to real-world robotics projects.
