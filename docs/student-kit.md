# A Compact Robotics Kit to Get Started

Not everyone can invest in a full humanoid robot. The **Economy Jetson Student Kit** gives you the essentials to **explore Physical AI and humanoid robotics** without breaking the bank.  

This kit lets you experiment with AI perception, navigation, and control in a hands-on way — your robot may not walk yet, but it can **see, think, and react**.

## Components of the Kit

| Component | Price (approx) | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Jetson Orin Nano / NX (8–16 GB) | ~$250–500 | Compact AI “brain” for robotics tasks |
| Intel RealSense D435i Depth Camera | ~$349 | Gives robot “eyes”: RGB + depth perception |
| USB Microphone / Speaker Array | ~$70 | Enables voice commands → robot listens and acts |
| MicroSD Card, cables, power | ~$30 | Basic infrastructure for standalone robotics experiments |

**Total Cost:** ~\$700 (USD)

> Think of this as a mini humanoid robot “head” with all the sensors and AI power — you can attach it to a small proxy robot, arm, or even a desk experiment.

## What You Can Do With It

- Build simple perception pipelines: the robot can detect objects and measure distances  
- Run AI models locally to practice navigation and path planning  
- Integrate voice commands with robot actions, using small-scale Vision-Language-Action experiments  
- Test and simulate ROS 2 nodes before scaling up to larger robots

---

## Why This Kit Matters

- Affordable way to **get hands-on experience** with real-world robotics  
- Understand the constraints of **embedded AI hardware** (memory, CPU/GPU limits)  
- Provides a stepping stone toward **full humanoid robot labs** or **cloud-integrated simulations**

Even without expensive hardware, you’ll gain **practical skills** that translate directly to larger robots and industrial setups.
