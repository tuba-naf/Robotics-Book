# Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

# What You’ll Achieve by the End of This Course

By the end of this course, you won’t just have theoretical knowledge — you’ll **build, see, and control a humanoid robot**. Each module contributes to a set of tangible skills, preparing you for real-world robotics and Physical AI projects.

## Key Skills You Will Master

- **Understanding Physical AI:** Learn why robots must operate in real environments, not just digital simulations.  
- **ROS 2 — The Robot Nervous System:** Build nodes, topics, and actions to control sensors and actuators.  
- **Simulation with Gazebo & Unity:** Safely test your robots in virtual worlds before touching hardware.  
- **Perception & Navigation with NVIDIA Isaac:** Teach robots to see, map, and move intelligently.  
- **Designing Humanoid Interactions:** Make robots perform human-like tasks and interact naturally.  
- **Integrating GPT Models:** Add conversational intelligence, enabling robots to follow verbal instructions.  
- **Capstone Development:** Deliver a working humanoid robot that can sense, plan, move, and act in real or simulated environments.

## Why These Outcomes Matter

- You’ll **bridge the digital and physical worlds**, turning code into tangible actions.  
- Your robot won’t just follow pre-programmed motions — it will **perceive, adapt, and respond**.  
- These skills are **transferable to real-world robotics**, from industrial automation to home assistance.  

Imagine building a robot assistant that can bring a glass of water when asked — you’ll know the full pipeline from voice command → planning → navigation → grasp → delivery.
