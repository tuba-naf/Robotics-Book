Till today, I have co-authored multiple books and crafted numerous pieces of poetry. However, this is my first book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, born from countless hours of co-learning with diverse AI agents, through explorations and experimentations, constantly pushing my boundaries.  

I dedicate this work to my father, **Muhammad Nafees**, whose unwavering love and support always lifts me up, quietly standing by me in every weather and every season. I am forever grateful for his patience and belief in me.  

I am profoundly grateful to the **GIAIC faculty**, our respected dean **Ameen Alam**, and all my IT teachers, especially **Hamza Syed**, whose guidance, encouragement, and wisdom illuminated my path.  

Who says AI will replace writers? Writers are gonna write anyway.  

In this project, I focused primarily on the architecture, the very skeleton of this book. Moving forward, I plan to refine its content further, explore deeper insights, and continue creating with AI as my companion. I look forward to writing many more books; this is just the beginning.
